Ambulance Management System

In this project an android app namely Ambulance Management System has been developed. There is most common rescue service 1122 which is managed through phone calls but it’s a unique idea in itself in which one can book an ambulance using an android smart phone.

The request for an ambulance made by the proposed app is directly updated on a
centralized main office, where 24/7 server will automatically check the request calculate coordinates and response back to the user and it’s respective nearest station. That request is in progress and from which station ambulance will come. All this process and management will handle virtually. The whole history will maintain on server side and also on user side. When task is done then status on app and sever side will be update. It develops for serving humanity in the situation of emergency by using precise and accurate results.
